# **PID** Control-based Line Follower Robot
### It can follow zigzag, curved, and discontinuous line.
### Black line on White Surface
### Worked with @nmsami36, who mainly developed the hardware
### Participated a number of nationwide robotic competitions with it.

Components Used:
- Arduino Mega as the controller 
- 5 IR LEDs in array as the sensor 
- DC Gear Motor 
- L298 Motor Driver 
and so on...

Programming environment: **Arduino IDE**

#### Some terminologies in the code:
Looking from the Back side of the robot, left motor is motor 'A', right motor is 'B', and the IR sensors 0 to 4 are counted from left to right.
